      " But something is different. The classrooms are the same, but everything"
      " is run down and dark. There are cobwebs everywhere, holes in the floors"
      " and walls, and turned over desks. You decide to look around to find a"
      " familiar face. As you walk, you notice the hallway seems too quiet,"
      " and you realize you're the only person in the entire school. Your"
      " heart starts to pound. You question where everyone else is. Despite"
      " your fear, you keep walking through the dark hall. You see something"
      " at the end of the hall. You're suddenly surrounded by a horrible smell."
      " You use you shirt to cover your nose and look down. You jump back, you" 
      " see blood and guts spilled out on the floor. It looks as if someone"
      " was just killed, but you thought you were the only one in the building."
      " Where are you? You keep staring at the decomposing body, you can't look away."
      " Suddenly, you hear something behind you. Maybe an axe dragging on the"
      " floor. There's laughing too. You turn around..."
